        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
        
I approach software design by beginning with requirements gathering. I need to know first what the user wants to do, and then I can begin with figuring out how.
Having a flowchart software like Lucid Chart, makes this visualization much easier. For this software, I made sure to set myself deadlines, and as I worked on each new week's
milestones, I would add what I had learned to this program. I think my biggest takeaway is that even though it seems insurmountable, by self-imposing deadlines, I would be able to
chip away at the larger task.

    How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I approach development with an open mind, and I am eager to learn different ways to achieve the same goal. My biggest task that I have begun setting for myself is to 
estimate how long that a task will take, and attempt to meet that goal. This will help later in my career as I need to give estimates for larger projects and daily
tasks that I am working on.

    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I may not work much more with computational graphics, but knowing how the program interacts with the GPU has helped open my eyes to the role that the GPU plays
in modern computing systems. It has also made me think much more about trying to be more effecient with my resource management. It has made me ask myself if I need
to recreate this object, or can I have it persist such that I can reuse it.
